# RFM Segmentation and Customer Analysis
# Project Overview: 
## Introduction
This project focuses on performing RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation of customer data to classify customers into various behavioral segments. RFM analysis helps businesses understand customer behavior, such as how recently they have made a purchase, how often they buy, and how much they spend. By categorizing customers, the company can optimize its marketing efforts, improve customer retention, and enhance profitability by targeting specific customer groups with tailored strategies.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to:

- Segment customers based on RFM analysis.
- Classify customers into various categories like Best Customers, Loyal Customers, At Risk, Lost Customers, Big Spenders, and others.
- Generate actionable insights to guide marketing strategies aimed at customer retention, re-engagement, and maximizing revenue.
- Visualize the results in a dashboard to track customer segments and their contribution to the business.
## Data Preparation
The customer data used for this analysis contains transaction-level records, including the following key attributes:

- InvoiceNo: Unique number assigned to each invoice.
- StockCode: Product identifier.
- Description: Product details.
- Quantity: Number of units purchased.
- InvoiceDate: Date of purchase.
- UnitPrice: Price per unit.
- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
- Country: Country of the customer.
Steps for Data Preparation:

1. Data Cleaning:
- Handled missing values, specifically customers without CustomerID.
- Removed transactions with negative values, which likely represented product returns.
2. RFM Score Calculation:
- Recency: Measured as the number of days since the customer’s last purchase.
- Frequency: Total number of transactions made by each customer.
- Monetary: Total amount spent by each customer.
3. RFM Score Assignment:
Customers were assigned scores for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary, each on a scale of 1 to 4 (with 4 being the highest value).
## Visualization and Analysis
Using Power BI, visualizations were created to analyze and represent customer segmentation based on the RFM model. Key charts include:

- Bubble Chart: Displays the relationship between Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values. Different customer segments are shown using the size of bubbles, helping to identify high-value customers visually.
- Heat Map: These charts represent the distribution of customer segments based on the number of customers.
- Bar Chart: These charts represent the distribution of customer segments based on their contribution to revenue.
The segmentation classified customers into 12 categories, including:

- Best Customers: Highest recency, frequency, and monetary value.
- Loyal Customers: Frequent buyers with a strong relationship with the brand.
- Big Spenders: Customers who spend the most but might not buy frequently.
- At Risk: Previously valuable customers who haven’t purchased recently.
- Lost Customers: Customers who haven’t made any recent purchases and have low frequency and spend.
- Potential Loyalists: Recent and frequent buyers with room to increase their spending.
- Other categories like Promising, Need Attention, and Cannot Lose Them were also identified.
## Insights
Key insights drawn from the RFM analysis are:

- Best Customers: They account for the largest portion of revenue. Retaining them is crucial for the company’s long-term profitability.
- Loyal Customers: This group also significantly contributes to revenue and purchases frequently. They are prime candidates for upselling and personalized engagement.
- At Risk: These customers haven't purchased recently but were valuable in the past. They need focused re-engagement efforts to prevent them from churning.
- Lost Customers: Contribute minimally to revenue and have the lowest potential for future purchases.
- Big Spenders: These customers contribute heavily in terms of monetary value but purchase less frequently, suggesting they could be nurtured with campaigns to increase frequency.
- Potential Loyalists: They are prime candidates for conversion into high-value, frequent buyers.
## Recommendations
Based on the insights, here are the tailored recommendations for each customer segment:

- Best Customers: Provide them with exclusive loyalty programs, early access to new products, and personalized recommendations to maintain their loyalty.
- Loyal Customers: Focus on upselling and cross-selling opportunities through personalized promotions. Keep them engaged with regular communication.
- Big Spenders: Increase purchase frequency by offering incentives such as free shipping, complementary products, or targeted deals.
- At Risk: Re-engage with personalized discounts and surveys to understand why they stopped purchasing. Consider targeted win-back campaigns.
- Lost Customers: Do not invest significant resources here, but run occasional last-ditch campaigns offering steep discounts.
- Potential Loyalists: Motivate them to increase basket size with cross-selling suggestions and personalized incentives.
## Conclusion
The RFM segmentation provided a detailed understanding of customer behavior and enabled the categorization of customers into actionable segments. By implementing the insights and recommendations, the company can:

- Focus on retaining high-value customers.
- Re-engage at-risk customers to reduce churn.
- Create targeted marketing campaigns to convert promising and potential loyalist customers into loyal, frequent buyers.
The next step is implementing these strategies within the marketing and customer engagement teams to optimize customer relationships and maximize revenue generation. Additionally, continuous tracking and updating of the RFM analysis will be critical for sustaining long-term business growth.
